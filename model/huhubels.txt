1. From training set, extract features
	FEATURE GENERATION
		a. token
		b. pos tag
		c. OOV - if token is not in the SCOWL dictionary
		   IV - if token is in the SCOWL dictionary

		   SCOWL DICTIONARY -> edited to accept only A(a) and I rather than all the alphabets (Upper|Loweret
		d. token before the current token
		e. token after the current token
		f. pos tag of [d]
		g. pos tag of [e] 
		h. proper nouns, usernames, mentions, punctuations, numerals and hashtags are considered IV
		i. word length (benchmark)
		j. numeric tokens are considered as IV
		k. prefix and suffix of the token (benchmark) [3 characters before and after]
		l. repetitive characters
		m. alphanumeric tokens - high probability of being OOV
		o. normalized form of the token [to be extracted from the training set]

		To be implemented features: 
		p. edit distance feature
		q. check if token is in the lexical normalization dictionary
		   OOV - if token is in the lexical normalization dictionary
		   IV - if token is in not the lexical normalization dictionary
